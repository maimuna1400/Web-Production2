                    <p>I was angry with my friend;<br>

                        I was angry with my foe: <br>
                        I told it not, my wrath did grow. <br>
                        <br>
                        And I waterd it in fears,<br>
                        Night & morning with my tears: <br>
                        And I sunned it with smiles,<br>
                        And with soft deceitful wiles. <br>
                        <br>
                        And it grew both day and night. <br>
                        Till it bore an apple bright. <br>
                        And my foe beheld it shine,<br>
                        And he knew that it was mine. <br>
                        <br>
                        And into my garden stole, <br>
                        When the night had veild the pole; <br>
                        In the morning glad I see; <br>
                        My foe outstretched beneath the tree.</p>
